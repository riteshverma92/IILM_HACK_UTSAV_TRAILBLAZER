Personalized Education System
Overview
The Personalized Education System is an AI-driven platform designed to help students achieve their learning goals efficiently. It provides tailored suggestions based on students' knowledge levels, helping them to stay on track and continuously improve. The system generates quizzes for initial assessments, suggests video content, and dynamically creates assessments based on the material the student has watched.

Features
Personalized Learning Path: The system adapts to each student's skill level, offering personalized recommendations.
Initial Knowledge Assessment: When a student searches for a topic (e.g., Python), an initial quiz is generated to assess their current knowledge.
Targeted Video Suggestions: Based on the student's performance, the system suggests relevant video content for improving their skills.
Dynamic Assessments: After watching a video, the system automatically generates an assessment quiz based on the content the student has watched.
Progress Tracking: Tracks how much a student has grasped and suggests the next steps for improvement.
System Workflow
Search and Initial Quiz:

The student searches for a topic, such as Python.
The system generates a short quiz to analyze the student's understanding of the topic.
Video Recommendations:

Based on the student's quiz results, personalized video content is suggested to fill knowledge gaps.
Post-Video Assessment:

If a student watches 20 minutes or more of the recommended content, the system generates an assessment to evaluate how much the student has learned.
The assessment is tailored to the specific portion of the content that the student watched.
Learning Suggestions:

After each assessment, the system provides personalized feedback and suggests further learning materials based on the student's performance.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask/Django (for serving the application)
